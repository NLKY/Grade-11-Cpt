# Grade-11-Cpt
*The source code and files of my grade 11 CPT*

To run this, you will need the Processing Java application downloaded
- Download the zip file
- Unzip it
- Go into the folder and double click on the Processing file to run it
(If you run into errors while trying to run it, try going to Tools > Add Tools > Libraries then add the Minim Audio Library)

However, if you don't have Processing Java - fear not I still got you covered
- Open the CPT_Game_Final_Build(pictures and source) folder
- Inside will be the source code of the game that can be viewed online
- I also provided some screenshots
